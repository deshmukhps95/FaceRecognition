# FaceRecognition
A Face Recognotion camera module having virtual database and a virtual camera
GUI Files- 3.py 5.py 6.py

Main files to be read-

  DataSetCreator.py
    ---image dataset is created using this file and stoed in a folder by assigning ID's to the user images (Unique ID to each user)
    ---ID is autogenerated at the time of each new user
    
  trainer.py 
    ---that data is trained by providing input images and labels and trained data is written in a file called trainingData.yml(file is in Recognizer folder)
    
  Detector.py
    ---this time user images coming from continuous streaming are feed to prediction and a label is got 
    ---additionally a label histogram is created and highest frequency label(ID's)  is got
    ---user is hence detected and recognised using that ID
    
  PyMongo.py
    ---CRUD operations for mongodb database
    
  FetchInformation.py
    ---Code(function) for fetching the information of new user using recognized ID in Detector code 
    
SMS.py(API)
    ---Here we have used online WaytoSMS free python API for the demo purpose    
  
  trail_mongodb_schedule.py 
    ---contains the code for the scheduling the users coming
    
Note: 
I am trying to apply machine learning approach to increase the performace of the virtual assistant by using SVM training testing
model. Now the system is giving 60-70% accuracy. The results will improve much by applying more image enhancement techniques with     parallel processing to make the system more fast and accurate.
